## Jack's code challenge

I chose to create a simple laravel blog to show basic competency with the framework. 

This demonstrates competency with:

- MVC layout
- CRUD
- Auth
- Middleware/Routes
- Migrations/Seeders
- Basic relationships between comments, users and posts
- Basic methods for validation via Requests classes and inline

This was designed to show a top level competency with the framework. If there is anything more specific you'd like to see, then let me know.
